This folder would normally contain face-api.js models.

However, to avoid requiring downloads, the application is now configured to load models directly from the face-api.js CDN:
https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/models/

The models used are:
- tiny_face_detector_model
- face_expression_model

This approach eliminates the need to download and host the models locally.
